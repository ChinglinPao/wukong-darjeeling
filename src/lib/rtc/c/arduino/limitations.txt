- Can't access static fields in a different infusion
- Instance/static/local variables limited to 64 bytes because of limited offset for LDD instruction (easy to fix)
- Not checking for null pointers (unsafe)
- Not checking for array bounds
- Not checking stack state when pushing/popping
- TODO: check r0 r1 during mul. may need to push/pop it
- branches are RJMPs: limited to 4K



--- performance only
- RTC_INVOKESTATIC does a lookup for every call. we could store the global_id directly, but this would depend on the infusion struct being at the same address every time.
