Questions for routing_wukong.c

- Line 133 and 134: Is S1 equal to s1? C is case sensitive and they
  should be different. 
- L140: Will this line block the function?
- Line 151: what's a wifi-server? 
- What's cid?
- RT_FAILED is used in several place:
	* Line 176: no path
	* Line 195: cannot find wifi cid based on LID.
- Line 199: the transmission is not actually completed. What's the
  return of radio_wifi_send()? The function return success when the
  data are written into UART port. It may fail to reach the
  destination.
	radio_wifi_send(): Lin 705, radio_wifi.c
	
- Line 202: the failure is casused by not finding IP address, not
  transmission. In this case, delay the transmission will not fix the
  problem.
- Line 209: is this line sending the failure message to someone?
- Line 213: if the transmission fails, variable ret has no value.
- Line 190 ~ 215: this is no error handling when the next interface is
  wifi but wifi radio is NOT used. Same problem applies for other
  radio.
